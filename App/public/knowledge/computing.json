In an emergency advise a staff member, and   if no one is available phone 111.    Attendance     Experience has shown that  if you   attend regularly and participate in the class   activities and assessments  you  are more likely to succeed.   F ull attendance and   commitment  are   encoura ged.  You are expected to be punctual and must comply   with the various behaviour and safety requirements of classrooms, workshops   and labs.    For   an  international   learner   satisfactory progress is defined as 100% attendance   and successful completion of 75% or more of your courses.          Non - Engagement      Ara has processes to deal with  learner s who formally enrol here but do not   “engage” with their studies.  That is, if you do not attend and/or participate   and/or submit assignments and/or sit assessments or only attend briefly or   spasmodically and/or do not engage significantly.       Let Ara know when you are absent from classes or if you are sick.    Contact your tutor or advise the Department by emailing  @ara.ac.nz"
