This project is a **Digital Technology Online Orientation** experience developed for the **Digital Technologies department (IT department)** at Ara Institute of Canterbury. The projects aim is to **streamline** the orientation process for new students and staff.

## Course Information
- **Course:** Software Development Project (BCDE311)
- **Semester:** Two 2025

## Project Overview
This application's primary goal is to **enhance the student experience** and **reduce the load on staff** by providing an easily accessible, **on-demand orientation**.

The client identified that the current in person orientation is often inconsistent, resource intensive, and inaccessible to late enrolling or international students. This leads to a high volume of repetitive staff inquiries and leaves students feeling lost.

The solution focuses on replacing the information-heavy lecture and the staff-intensive 'Amazing Race' activity with a digital platform featuring two main components:
1.  **AI Chatbot:** A central tool for instant, accurate answers to student questions.
2.  **Virtual Tour:** A gamified, **360-degree walkthrough** that allows students to explore the campus and find key locations at their own pace.

The project is guided by the principle of placing the end-user at the **centre** of the design process.

## Key Features
The app delivers a range of features designed to make the onboarding process clear and engaging:

- **AI-Powered Q&A:** An intelligent chatbot designed to answer student questions accurately and efficiently. Its knowledge base is **restricted** to specific Ara information to ensure integrity and prevent giving incorrect external information.
- **Gamified Campus Quest:** An interactive 360 virtual campus tour designed to replicate the fun of the original Amazing Race activity, helping students navigate the campus confidently.
- **Digital Platform:** The entire solution is a web-based experience accessible on various devices, including **phones, tablets, and computers**.
- **Updateable Content:** An administrative system will be provided, allowing **non-technical staff members** to easily update images and information for the tour and chatbot knowledge base.
- **Community Focus:** The project is designed to help students feel like a part of the Ara student community, ultimately helping to **boost student retention**.
